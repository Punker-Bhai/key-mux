# KEY-MUX

*****ABOUT*****

* While using termux when we have to use keys like control alt or up or down arrow we use Touch keyboard which comes in by default with termux app. But in that touch keyboard, we don't get arrow right and arrow left as well as other keys which we can see on a normal keyboard
* To access extra keys while using termux, a lot of uses, as well as YouTubers, install the hacker's keyboard. In my opinion, it is just a waste of storage and changing my Google keyboard with a new complicated keyboard just to use termux is too much effort for me.

If you want to use extra keys in termux you can use some commands provided by the official termux website but creating a properties file with the code provided by the termux is a little bit work. I have just combined multiple commands.
* Just Install it using the below commands
